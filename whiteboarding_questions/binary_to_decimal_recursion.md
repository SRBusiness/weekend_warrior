## Binary to decimal using recursion

### Prompt:
[Given a decimal number as input, we need to write a program to convert the given decimal number into equivalent binary number.](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/decimal-binary-number-using-recursion/)

### Notes or Hints:
I would suggest reviewing the cs_fun class notes on how to convert binary to decimal before you start

### Example Implementations:
- You can link from basically anything (gist, google doc, code file online etc.) as long as it is shared publicly.
  - please make sure you include both time and space complexity, if time allows a brief description
- There are multiple ways to solve each of these problems if you have a varient solution in the same language please add it below in its own so it is next to other implementations in the same language
