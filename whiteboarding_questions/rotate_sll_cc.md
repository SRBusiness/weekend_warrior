## Problem title

### Prompt:

Given a singly linked list, rotate the linked list counter-clockwise by k nodes. Where k is a given positive integer. For example, if the given linked list is 10->20->30->40->50->60 and k is 4, the list should be modified to 50->60->10->20->30->40. Assume that k is smaller than the count of nodes in linked list.

### Notes or Hints:
The geeks for geeks solution is different from mine so check it out if you want to see a different implementation.

### Example Implementations:
- You can link from basically anything (gist, google doc, code file online etc.) as long as it is shared publicly.
  - please make sure you include both time and space complexity, if time allows a brief description
- There are multiple ways to solve each of these problems if you have a varient solution in the same language please add it below in its own so it is next to other implementations in the same language
