# White-boarding problems

For the actual documents with your white boarding question please make clear what the prompt is and code it out in at least one language. Either make a gist and link the gist or create a file with your code and put it in the whiteboarding_questions directory. If others have coded it out in a different language please include a link that is the title of the language you coded it in and your initial so people can know who to ask if they have questions.
